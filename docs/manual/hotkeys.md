# Hotkeys

On Herald OS Linux the system key is `Super` (the Windows or Command key); in the virtual machine on
a Mac it is `Alt` instead, because macOS keeps `Command` for itself. `Super+K` shows every Linux
shortcut on screen. Herald's own pages also answer to `Ctrl` on Linux, so `Ctrl+K` and `Ctrl+1`
work everywhere.

## Omarchy keys (Herald OS Linux)

Coming from Omarchy? Settings > General > Keymap, or `herald-os keymap omarchy`, makes `Super+C`,
`Super+X` and `Super+V` copy, cut and paste in every app, terminals included. Talking to Hermes
moves to `Super+Shift+V` and centring a column to `Super+Ctrl+C`; `herald-os keymap herald` switches
back.

## Your own shortcuts

On Herald OS Linux, add binds to `~/.config/niri/local.kdl`, which Herald OS never overwrites; any
`herald-os` command can be a bind, and binding a key Herald OS already uses replaces it.
[Make it yours](make-it-yours.md#keyboard-shortcuts) has examples, including switching a key off,
and Hermes can write them for you: "add a shortcut that opens Obsidian".
