# herald-os-bridge

The Hermes plugin that lets Hermes act on the computer and drive the Herald OS interface. It is a
regular out-of-tree plugin: Hermes loads it from `$HERMES_HOME/plugins/herald-os-bridge`, a link
`npm run bootstrap` creates to this folder. Nothing in the Hermes core is patched.

Tools, permission tiers, protected paths, the policy file and the audit log are documented in
[docs/SYSTEM-BRIDGE.md](../../docs/SYSTEM-BRIDGE.md).

## Enabling it by hand

`npm run bootstrap` does all of this. Without it:

```bash
ln -s "$PWD/plugins/herald-os-bridge" ~/.hermes/plugins/herald-os-bridge
hermes plugins enable herald-os-bridge
hermes tools enable herald_os
```

To switch the tools off without uninstalling, set `herald_os.bridge.enabled: false` in
`~/.hermes/config.yaml`, or `HERALD_OS_BRIDGE_DISABLED=1` in the backend's environment for one run.

To take it all back, `herald-os setup --undo` on Linux; elsewhere the steps, and the list of what
Herald OS changes in Hermes, are in
[docs/SYSTEM-BRIDGE.md](../../docs/SYSTEM-BRIDGE.md#what-herald-os-changes-in-your-hermes).
