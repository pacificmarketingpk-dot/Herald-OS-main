"""Herald OS system bridge.

Registers the ``herald_os`` toolset: a narrow set of explicit, permission-tiered tools that let
Hermes act on the computer it is running on. Execution goes through a per-platform
``HostAdapter`` (macOS and Linux implemented; Windows is a typed stub), permissions through
``bridge.permissions`` (tiers, protected paths, the upstream approval gate), and every call is
recorded by ``bridge.audit``. ``system_os`` (registered from the same ``TOOL_SPECS`` table) drives
Herald OS Linux's ``herald-os`` CLI and answers with a clear failure on other platforms. The tools
are offered and run only in Herald OS's own sessions (``bridge.scope``).

Out-of-tree by design: the plugin uses only public plugin APIs (``register``,
``ctx.register_tool``, ``ctx.register_skill``, ``tools.approval.request_tool_approval``) and the
session variables Hermes binds for tools (``gateway.session_context.get_session_env``) so Herald
OS never patches the Hermes core.
