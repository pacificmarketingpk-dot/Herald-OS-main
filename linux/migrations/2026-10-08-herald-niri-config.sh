# ~/.config/niri/config.kdl, which is the person's. Renders the new file, then turns Herald's old copy
# of config.kdl (recognised by its first line) into an include of it: a niri still running with the
# old path reloads into the same config, and `niri validate -c ~/.config/niri/config.kdl` still
# checks Herald's. A config.kdl of the person's own is left alone. Safe to re-run.
