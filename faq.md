# FAQ

**Does Herald OS send my files to the AI?**
Only what you or Hermes put in a conversation. Hermes reads a file when a task needs it, through
tools you can see in the chat and in the audit log. "Pick up where you left off" sends names and
dates (file names, project branches, chat titles), never contents, and only after you turn it on.

**Which AI model does it use?**
Whatever your Hermes is set up with: a Nous Portal subscription, or an API key for OpenRouter,
OpenAI, Anthropic, a local model and others. Change it in Settings > Hermes & agents or with
`hermes model`.

**What does it cost?**
Herald OS is free and open source. The model is billed by its provider; Settings > Usage shows how
much Hermes has used this week and this month, and what is left on a Nous Portal plan.

**Can it break my computer?**
Anything that changes something asks first; moving files to the Trash and stopping programs ask
every time, and Herald OS never deletes permanently. Keep backups of anything you let an agent touch,
as with any software that acts on your behalf.

**Do I have to use voice?**
No. Everything works from the keyboard, and the microphone is never opened unless voice is on.

**Can I use my own themes, keyboard shortcuts and scripts?**
Yes: see [Make it yours](make-it-yours.md).

**How is this different from Omarchy?**
Omarchy makes Linux something your coding agent can fix and reshape. Herald OS makes the agent how
you use the computer, for everyone, and it asks before it changes anything. It also runs on the Mac
you already have, and Herald OS can run as an app on Arch Linux and Omarchy.

**How do I update?**
On a Mac, `git pull` and `npm run bootstrap` in your checkout; Hermes updates itself with
`hermes update`. On Herald OS Linux, the menu's Update, or `herald-os update`.
